# Generates broad purpose demo data for explaining tidyverse and statistics

# whether watching a movie about journalism can affect trust in journalists.
# - Two repeated measures: trust before and after the intervention
# - Three groups: control, positive about journalism, negative about journalism 
# - Other variables: age, newspaper subscription, news consumption
